// wall climb pure half: constants + the hop state machine. No engine types, gate-tested by tests/wallclimb_test.cpp.
//
// A climb is ground -> hop -> one-tick sweep that grounds the hull flush on a displacement seam -> hop again.
// The sweep lives in wallclimb.inl (engine sims). What can be tested cold is here: the armed hop (an air win marks
// the ground tick it bought, the launch fires on the REAL grounded tick, a refused press is released for one tick
// so m_nOldButtons clears) and the prevent-slow test.
