// ============================================================================
// WHOLE-MAP PIXEL SURF SCAN -- every brush in the map, one seam at a time
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The crosshair finder (psassist.inl) answers "is there a surf on THIS wall, between these two
// heights". This answers "where are they, all of them", and draws each one as a line along the
// whole length of the seam instead of a dot.
//
// It does NOT scan a grid. A pixel surf is a solver artifact on the TOP EDGE OF A BRUSH'S WALL
// FACE (psassist.inl's own note: no trace can screen for one, only the sim can -- but the sim
// has to be pointed somewhere), and the collision BSP still has the mapper's brushes as
// authored. So:
//   1. IEngineTrace::GetBrushesInAABB over the whole world, GetBrushInfo for each brush's planes
//      (fakemove.inl FM_Brushes already does exactly this for the wall-jump seam gate).
//   2. ps_map.h turns each brush into its wall faces' top edges -- a horizontal segment with real
//      ends, which is the length that gets drawn. Rows of brushes merge back into one seam.
//   3. every seam is sampled along its length, and each sample is handed to the SAME column
//      scanner the crosshair finder uses (PfScanChunk, one cell), so probes, prunes, strict mode
//      and the prop gates are one implementation, not two.
// Sequential by construction: one budgeted slice per command, cursor in statics, cancellable,
// and the lines appear seam by seam while it runs.
//
// TEXTUREBUGS COME OUT OF THE SAME WALK (PmTbProbe). A texturebug is a horizontal texture
// boundary on a flush wall, which IS a brush top edge with the wall carrying on above it -- the
// candidate this file already has. Two line traces per sample settle it, against the ~24 sims a
// pixel surf costs, and each one becomes a red ring the route calculator can place a TEXTUREBUG
// marker on. Before this they existed only on a column you aimed at by hand.
//
// WHAT IT REFUSES, and both were in the report ("finds a lot of surfs inside walls or out of
// bounds"): a spot whose leaf is CONTENTS_SOLID (the face is buried inside another brush) or
// PointOutsideWorld (the outward faces of the shell that seals the map). A swept trace cannot
// answer either -- it reports where a sweep stopped, never whether it began somewhere real --
// so both are asked of the BSP directly, ahead of the sims, at PmSpotUsable. The scan also runs
// the strict gates whatever the checkbox says (psassist.inl): thousands of lines on geometry you
// never looked at have nothing to be weighed against.
//
// Not found here, by construction: displacement walls and prop surfaces (neither is a brush),
// and seams on faces more than ~11 degrees off vertical (k_psMapMaxNz).

// of the edges in a map (floors, stairs, crates, rooftops). One ray just above the edge kills
// them for the price of a trace instead of 24 movement sims.
// The catch is a sub-unit thing at the FEET, so the ray goes just over the edge and not at chest
// height: a stub of wall a few units tall above the seam is still a surf, and asking at 24 would
// throw every one of those away.
// THREE HEIGHTS, NOT ONE, AND startsolid IS A NO. Both halves of that were wrong:
//   * 6u was the only height asked, so the very stubs the low ray existed to keep -- a 2u lip
//     over the edge -- came back "no wall" and were never simmed. 2 / 6 / 16 covers a stub, an
//     ordinary course and a tall wall, for two extra line traces against the ~24 sims they gate.
//   * startsolid meant "already inside it: the wall is certainly there", and the ray starts 8u
//     OUT FROM THE FACE. Being inside something out there is not this wall carrying on above the
//     seam, it is a second brush (or a clip) standing in front of the spot, and no hull rides a
//     lip buried in one. That branch is a straight source of the "surfs inside walls" report.
//     Per height, so a lip at the base does not condemn the two heights above it.
