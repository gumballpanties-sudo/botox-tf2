// ============================================================================
//  ROUTE CALCULATOR -- every combination that completes the route, from TF2's own
//  movement code.
//
//  Place markers in order (ground, pixelsurf, edgebug, headbang, texturebug), press calculate, read every
//  press sequence that completes them: "walk off -> jumpbug -> pixelsurf (stand) -> longjump".
//  Moves are only the replicable ones, each one of dih's own binds: jump, minijump, longjump,
//  jumpbug, and off the start walk off / crouch walk off. You run the approach; this only answers
//  the vertical half, which is the half that decides everything at a pixel.
//
//  THE PHYSICS IS routesim.h, NOT THIS FILE. A z-only port of CTFGameMovement, same float/double
//  order as the engine, run analytically -- no Pred_Simulate per leg, so a whole DAG of routes is
//  searched and every combination is counted. ..16 flew presses one at a time through the
//  engine with zero horizontal speed and ranked them by a recorder; that could never see a
//  catch, never chain one leg's landing height into the next, and never list more than a guess.
//  Why the port can be trusted:
//    * tests/routesim_test.cpp replays the hops recorded on hightower (/16 ledgers): the
//      bhop launch ladder (-255.26 / -254.56 jump, -255.25 / -254.53 longjump) to 5e-5, longjump
//      caught from -254.53 7 of 7, missed from lower 0 of 13, jump 0 of 37 -- all exact.
//    * every solve flies jump / longjump / minijump / jump + jumpbug through Pred_Simulate beside
//      the port from where you stand (RcEngineCheck) and logs the worst |dz|. If the engine and the
//      port ever disagree the panel says so on its first line.
//  What it cannot know: horizontal. It assumes you are over a floor when you land on it, beside a
//  ledge while below its top, and at a bhop speed under 1.2x maxspeed, where
//  PreventBunnyJumping leaves a standing hop's vz alone (there is no 'hop speed' knob any more).
//
//  Read in C:\dih\debug.log: `RC: solve`, `RC: engine check`, `RC: marker`, `RC: layers`,
//  `RC: combo`.
//
//  WHAT YOU AIM AT NAMES THE TYPE -- there is no 'place as' combo:
//    * a grey pixel finder pin (or an assist target off one) under the crosshair = a PIXELSURF
//      marker, a red seam ring = a TEXTUREBUG marker. Those two exist nowhere else: no ring, no
//      seam marker, ever, and the pixel calculator's marker obeys the same rule (grey only).
//    * no ring in the window -> the FACE names the type, no combo and no bind: a floor face is a
//      ground marker, a ceiling face a headbang, a wall face is REFUSED with the normal in the
//      message instead of stored at a height you never aimed at. An edgebug is a ground marker
//      switched to edgebug in its own row in the menu (it is the same ledge, read differently).
//    * picking a point is an ANGLE to the ring drawn for it (rs::AimTanTo), with no "not past the
//      surface the ray hit" clause: a lip in front of the wall no longer eats the snap.
//
//
//    * the PIXEL CALCULATOR is its own feature (g_pixelCalc) with its own keys and its own
//      marker/panel toggles -- turning either feature off takes its points off the screen. One
//      press answers the pixel off a single jump AND with 1, 2, 3 hops on your own flat in front
//      of it (land and press again, or jumpbug off it): k_pcMaxHops, one solve per hop count.
//    * TEXTUREBUG markers (rs::PT_TEXTUREBUG): place one on a pixel finder seam (the red rings)
//      and the solve answers what the seam does to the route. Physics in routesim.h.
//    * the marker ray: a ring of rays around the crosshair so a handrail is hittable, a
//      MASK_SOLID retry when a player clip brush you are standing in makes the ray start solid,
//      and own-team buildings solid to it by network class instead of by collision group.
//    * a grounded start is read as STANDING even while you crouch -- see RcSolveBegin.
//    * the engine-check disagreement line no longer prints on the panel (still logged).

// ---- PICKING A FINDER POINT ---------------------------------------------------------
// THE POINT YOU AIM AT IS THE MARKER TYPE. The finder draws two kinds of ring and they mean
// different things, so the ring under the crosshair already answers "what am I placing":
//   * a grey ring  (s_psFinderPts + the assist targets saved off them) -> PIXELSURF
//   * a red seam   (s_psTbPts / s_psMapTbPts, PfScanSeams + the map walk) -> TEXTUREBUG
//   * no ring at all -> not a seam marker, the surface you aimed at is (ground/edgebug/headbang)
// The rc24 rule this replaces was the other way round: you said the type first and only that set
// was searched. It worked but made the type a separate press per marker. The 2.5 deg window
// (rs::AimTanTo) is what keeps the two sets apart when both are on the same wall -- the ring you
// are actually centred on wins, and rc21's "nearest point of any kind by raw distance" is what
// made a 0.4u-away seam beat the grey ring you aimed at.
// bPsOnly keeps the pixel calculator on grey rings alone: its marker IS a pixelsurf by definition.
// Ranking is by how centred the crosshair is on the ring. Gone with rc21's rule: the "not past the
// surface the ray hit (+16u)" clause. It read a lip 200u in front of the wall as the end of the
// ray and refused the point you were looking at (report 4: "it places it nowhere near that
// point"). A ring is a thing you aim AT; what the ray bumps into on the way is not a vote.
